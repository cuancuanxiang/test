# MoTIF: An end-to-end Multimodal Road Traffic Scene Understanding Foundation Model 

# :rocket:
Our contributions can be mainly divided into the following parts:
1. Fine-tuned MFM: the research in this paper focuses on improving the recognition ability of MFMs in the complex environment of traffic roads. By means of the low-rank efficient fine-tuning matrix (LoRA), the model proposed in this paper is trained to refine various types of events in road traffic, which ensures the model's accurate recognition and inference ability in road traffic scenarios.
2.  Multi-metric output and event reasoning for road traffic: the model proposed in this paper outputs structured descriptive information, which enables the detection and analysis of various types of traffic events. The specific inference ability of the multi-modal large model makes it possible to further deduce the traffic state.
3.  Video annotated dataset for traffic roads: In this paper, we construct a multimodal exclusive dataset for video detection of traffic roads. We propose a set of automated video image annotation methods for traffic target object detection and semantic segmentation fusion for highways, and use Q-A question and answer pairs to annotate roadside surveillance videos of highways. Based on the above video and annotation information, this paper constructs an industry standard multi-modal dataset.
